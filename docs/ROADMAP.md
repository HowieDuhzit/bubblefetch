# Roadmap

This roadmap is a lightweight list of ideas and areas to explore. Use it as a guide
when prioritizing contributions.

## Core improvements

- Expand remote (SSH) collectors and error reporting.
- Add more modules (package counts, media status, weather).
- Improve Windows support where possible (non-plugin paths).

## UX and theming

- Add more ASCII art variants and theme presets.
- Improve theme previews and config wizard flow.
- Provide a gallery of community themes.

## Quality and tooling

- Broader automated tests and CI coverage.
- Linting via `golangci-lint` in CI.
- Release automation for multi-platform binaries.
